Here is the start of an Emacs-based front-end to the
Arch User Repository (AUR).
Put aurquery.el and json.el on your load-path, and evaluate 
(require 'aurquery)
You can search the AUR using the command M-x aur-search.
Soon, you will be able to request info pertaining to a package using
M-x aur-info.

At this moment, the code won't work.  Be patient!
