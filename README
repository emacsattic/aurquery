Introduction
============
aurquery-el is an Emacs-based front-end for the Arch User Repository
(AUR).  At present, it offers little functionality.  It provides two features:
search for a package, and obtain detailed information about a package.
aurquery-el saves time and keystrokes for those of us whose primary operating
environment is Emacs.

Installation
============
Copy aurquery.el and json.el to some directory in your load-path.
Add the form (require 'aurquery) to your .emacs.  It couldn't be simpler.

Usage
=====
Aurquery-el provides two user-visible commands: aur-search and aur-info.
The user might wish to bind these to keystrokes in the global keymap.
aur-search prompts for a list of keywords, and it uses these to query the
server.  It creates a new buffer and fills it with results.  Each line
of the buffer contains the name of a single package.
aur-info asks the user for the name of a package.  It requests detailed
information about that package from the server and places the details in
a new buffer.  Both commands place the user in the buffer that contains
their results.
